            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea it is obſerued, that the beſt &amp; quickeſt wits, if they be not well instructed, commonly breake out into actions of moſt viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp;

            <p>Such alſo as are accounted to be of a good nature, that is, to be pliable, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to giue contentment to others from their owne bounty and affection, do ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt fall into debaſements by the ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their fellowes, whome they haue neither prouidence to eſchew, nor courage to reprehend; but ſuffer themſelues to be entangled with good fellowſhip, as byrds with lime-twigs, and ſo periſh wittingly by their owne facility.</p>
            <p>I need not here to aggrauate the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which ariſeth by theſe occaſions, nor the neceſsity of good Counſell to hinder their Progreſſe, and beate men backe from ill Company: nor how great wrong thoſe do to their Countrey and Friendes who hinder ſuch as haue most need of helpe, from conuerſation with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as imploy their endeauours moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
<pb facs="tcp:28026:5"/> in the ſetting forward of vertue, and repreſsing of vice; for the enſuing diſcourſe will ſufficiently declare it.</p>
            <p>Only this I would haue thee (Prudent Reader) to vnderſtand, that my drift is not to write of theſe ſubiects, by way of amplification, or laboured colours of ſtile, but only to lay downe briefly ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall arguments that confirme the truthes which I ſeeke to perſwade; obſeruing the methode, which nature, and practice of doctrine require in like caſes.</p>
            <p>And for entrance to the extirpation of theſe three pernicious vices, &amp; better vnderſtanding of all that followeth; it may pleaſe thee to conſider firſt the force of cuſtome, to change opinion euen in the moſt palpable and ſenſible thinges. As is proued by a priſoner which hath liued ſome tyme in a ſtinking priſon, and is no more troubled with the bad ſent that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed him in the beginninge, and were inough to make another which ſhould come a new out of the freſh ayre, to caſt
<pb facs="tcp:28026:6"/> his gorge.</p>
            <p>The ſame is exemplified by that which hapned to <hi>Plutarke</hi> his gueſt, who bidae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dinner by his frend, could eat nothing the first day, becauſe, forſooth, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife of the houſe, whome he ſuppoſed had dreſſed the meate, was blear-eyed. The next day he had the like difficulty to ouercome his apprehenſion, yet he eate ſomething. But the third day, cuſtome had abated his auerſion ſo farre, that he eate his meate as well as the reſt. This is taught vs in the old ſaying, <hi>ab aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis non fit paſſio:</hi> and we might bring a thouſand other examples to confirme it.</p>
            <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d obſeruation may be, that (as it is ſayd) in apparell and the like, fooles bringe vp faſhions, and oblige wiſe men to follow them, many times againſt their willes, not to be holden for ſingular.</p>
            <p>The third is deduced from theſe two, that diſcre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te men and women, which are become Apes in apparell, not by deſire but vpon opinion of neceſsity, and not to

            <p>And this was to be remembred before hand in the abuſe of Apparell: for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Drinking and Swearing are ſo foule &amp; fooliſh of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as they need no more (but to be conſidered) to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by any reaſonable man. For the rest, ſuch I meane as by cuſtome of ſinne are transformed into beaſts, be not capable of diſcipline, but muſt be left to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and iuſtice of Almighty God: who keep thee euer (Gentle Reader) in the feare of his Iudgements, and loue of his mercy.

               <p>3. There may be thought vpon three cauſes, why the ſoule by reaſon, &amp; will ſecketh to beautifie the body through the vſe of Apparell. The firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the cloſe, and neere coniunction, which is betwixt the body, and the ſoule, as hath beene ſayd: for which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the ſoule procureth to hide and diſſemble with honeſt apparell, what through ſin or natures defect, is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the body. From he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce procedeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:28026:14"/> that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> obſerueth, as natural<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> in man concerning Apparell. Such as we thinke (ſayth he) to be the baſer parts of the body, we apparel them with more honor: and the leſſe honeſt parts with more ſhew of honeſty.</p>
               <p>4. Another cauſe from which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth this affection in the ſoule to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the body, may be thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this; that ſhe knoweth the body to be her inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to accompliſh many excellent endeuors; as to exerciſe tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in meate and drinke; continency in other pleaſures; prudence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the creatures committed to reaſons charge; fortitude to conquer her enemies, and the like, as it is noted<note place="margin">Mercur. in Pymond.</note> by <hi>Mercurius Triſmegistus.</hi> In which off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:28026:15"/> why this care is ſo common to euery ones cogitation, that few (according to their ability) omit to do it more or leſſe. And therefore, as the occaſion is ſubiect to exceſſe, ſo the moderation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth prudence, and vertue.</p>
               <p>8. Now to come to the particular differences of Apparel in diuers Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we may conſider them in two ſortes.

Heate of the ſunne, and cold, in different climates, giue occaſion to the inhabitans, to make their cloathes thicker, or finer as neceſſity requireth.</p>

Wherefore this truth ſuppoſed, we are not, with vnciuill rigour, to debarre nature wholy of all Arte in the forme and vſe of mans attire: Only we muſt beware that admitting Art and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip for the help and perfection of nature, it be not permitted to range ſo farre, as it deſtroy the originall intent of nature: As for example, if one ſhould heape art vpon art in things needleſſe and extreame coſtly, farre fetched and deare bought, only for vanity, without any other purpoſe. For the ornament of Apparell, being only an accidentall perfection of man, and of little mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in reſpect of other endowments of his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:28026:18"/> body and mind, if in this kind, any ſhew of extrauagant exceſſe do appeare, it will be an argument to the beholders, that in ſuch a perſon is no internall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of any great worth, ſeing him wholy addicted to an externall toy; and that his wis and valour reach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Taylers Cut, and colours of his cloathes: as if the glory of the Ape conſiſted only in his pyde or motly coate.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore, artificiall inuention is not to depart too farre from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of nature or naturall parability: leſt the wit of the perſon ſo curiouſly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, may ſeeme to haue beene wholy ſpent in the purſuite it had after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of his cloathes: or he ſo ſeriouſly imployed thereabout, as he would haue the world thinke it the whole drift of his deſignes, and that his capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reacheth no further.</p>
               <p>4. And aſſuredly, there is no one outward argument, which more playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually proueth that the ſouſe harboured within that body, hath no talent of any great worth, as too much affectation of Art in Apparell: for it

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:28026:23"/> is not a natural obiect to the eyes; ſo ſuch kind of Apparel as moſt diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the body, is leaſt decent. In regard whereof, it beſeemes not Gentry, and much leſſe Nobility, to be ſeene ſtripped in dublet and hoſe: which habit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenteth Inconſtancy, Petulancy, Lightneſſe, and the like affections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to magnanimity. Yea the Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, at this day, ſcorneth in this reſpect the attire of Chriſtians, as not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently modeſt, but rather as a teſtimony of effeminacy: in that our cloathes are not ſide inough, whileſt they diſcouer thoſe parts of the body which ſhould be hidden. And we ſee the Robes of the Parlament, and of the Iudgement ſeat, proportionable to repreſent ſtate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and greatneſſe of mind, to be long; and conſequently, graue, decent, and honourable.</p>
               <p>9. Laſtly it is moſt diſagreable to the dignity of man, to be dayly diuers, and mutable in the faſhions &amp; colours of his apparell: for thereby we giue notice of two things appertayning to our natural conſtitution which impayre much our credit. Firſt it argueth want of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:28026:23"/> and ſecondly much wandring &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inconſtancy of mind; both very diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefull to perſons of account. Philoſophy teacheth, Iudgment or practicall reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of mind to be then moſt firme, when it iſſueth from longer, or dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conſideration. Whereupon it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that melancholy people, as they are commonly more valerous and wiſe, ſo are they more conſtant and vnremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable in their opinions &amp; iudgments, for that they conclude not, but after much deliberation, and ſearch of the cauſes, effects, and circumſtances of that which they reſolue: and ſo neither do they alter their reſolutions but vpon like ſerious conſideration for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part.</p>
               <p>10. Wherefore, when a Nation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be various and vnconſtant in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; it is a great proofe, yea an open confeſſion, that their vnderſtandings do not in this poynt, diue ſo deep as they ſhould, nor perceiue ſufficiently what is truly decent, and conuenient. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe they made their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon a light ground, not being able or willing to reach any further; they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:28026:24"/> change eaſily &amp; often vpon the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, ſtill remayning in chaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the idle contentment of fooliſh pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ſies: as if a man ſhould imploy himſelfe continually, and all his cogitations and labours, to giue ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the wiſhes and deſires of a child. Which being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt childiſhnes and folly, why ſhould any prudent man make reckoning of the friendſhip of ſuch perſons or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may ſeeme as mutable in affection towards vs, as they are in their apparell towards themſelues. And what ſoeuer promiſe, or proteſtation they make of conſtancy; how can they be more aſſured of themſelues, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we of them, then they were of their former election, in the faſhion of their cloathes? for the Weather-cocke is ſubiect to all manner of windes, and ready to turne with euery blaſt.</p>
               <p>11. And if this mutability and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangleneſſe be ſo reprouable in the firſt Inuenters of new faſhions; it cannot be honeſt in ſuch nations or perſons as take them vp at the ſecond-hand; for they declare themſelues as mutable as the firſt inuenters, and as little ſetled as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:28026:24"/> they in their iudgement and deſire; yea which is worſe, they adde of their owne another degree of debaſement, publiſhing to all that looke vpon them, that they had not wit inough to play the fooles without a patterne; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though as newfangled as the beſt) yet were forced to come behind, not for want of good will, but of inuention and wit to find out themſelues the new faſhions, which they are glad to imitate.</p>

Wherefore ſeing that ſo many inconueniences ariſe, as well againſt common Ciuility, as againſt priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and vertue by the abuſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, which no doubt would be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if men fell once into a mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the truth: it will be good to open a little more the generall cauſes and heades of this vanity, to the end, that being knowne, the Cure thereof may be more eaſie.</p>

And ſo thoſe which employ their cogitations, in ſenſuall pleaſures, deſcribe alſo their thoughts (as the proud man doth) in the vanity and variety or their cloathes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with weaklings being doted, are taken in Cobwebs, &amp; become captiues in the ſame fetters and chaynes. And for that reaſon affordeth no ſufficient argument to perſwade a man to ſuch groſſe and foule delights as are common to brute beaſt; therefore, the ſenſuall poyſoned ſpider lurking in her hole, vſeth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell as a lure to call the ſilly fly into her nets: for the ſenſes haue there moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where reaſon is moſt weake.</p>

For ſuch is the quality of mans nature, that when in his iudgement he admireth, and in his heart exalteth the diuinity and greatnes of Almighty God; then doth he moſt of all humble and debaſe himſelfe: And to the contrary, when he forgetteth God, and liueth without feare of his iudgments, &amp; prouidence of the life to come, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he extoll him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and declineth from the care of his ſoule, to the loue of his body, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his time, ſtudy, and endeuours to pamper and adorne it, and to ſerue it as an Idoll. And this hapneth not onely

And ſo the old Romans, whilſt they held reuerence (after their faſhion) to Diuinity, as Nature it ſelfe teacheth all Nations to do, vpon a reaſonable iudgement of their owne vnworthines, ſubiection, and dependence of a higher prouidence; they contented themſelues with ſuch things as ſerued meerely for ſuccour againſt neceſſity, abſtayning from ſuper fluityes, which they thought might be diſpleaſant to the power that gouerneth with order, or ſerued only for their owne magnificence and glory. <hi>The Romanes being in flower</hi> (ſaith Saluſt)<note place="margin">Saluſt. de coniur.</note>

But in this kind, that which is particularly and moſt iniurious to the ſoueraignty of nature, is the ſhamefull practice of painting the face: wherein they vſe liquors diſtilled from filthy weeds, from gums and poyſoned iuyces, which once aduanced aboue their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall degree to the viſage of a woman, and plaſtered vpon the cheife manſion of a reaſonable ſoule created to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Almighty God; there, they eate and fret the skin; there, they putrifie, feſter, and dry vp into parchment the place where they were put to cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty, which they might as wel do vpon an old buskin as vpon a wrinckled twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted face, yea a great deale better, and with a freſher gloze, and longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. What baſenes then, is it for a man that he may ſeeme (forſooth) a man or a woman according to her ſexe, (and not in may-games or monſters) to begge with much labour, payne, and hurt to themſelues, ſuch ornaments as I haue ſpoken off, with ſo much diſparagme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, if confideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be duly made, as though nature and reaſon had not remembred, to giue ſufficient and conuenient orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>6. So is it appoynted by our creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the vitall motion of nature, that our life conſiſting of the action of heate that feedeth vpon moyſture, as the flame in the lamp feedeth vpon the oyle by little and little, the moyſture ſhould be conſumed, and with it that freſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and flower of beauty which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is cauſed, fade and decay. After the ſame manner, and with the ſame end that nothing be permanent that is made only for vſe and paſſage to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all the ſeaſons of the yeare haue their peculiar properties, ornaments, &amp; graces, with amiable intercourſe of change; which teach vs the ſeuerall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities and comlineſſe of all the parts of our life. To our youth, becauſe it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth experience, prudence, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preheminences that are not due but to induſtry and time (and ſpecially to women, as to the moſt deficient by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſexe) is giuen the veyle of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:28026:31"/> exterior beauty, or good fauour to couer other wants.</p>
               <p>7. Now, when this ſpring and ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are paſt, and Autume hath brought the bloſſoms to fruite, and green fruite to maturity; what a folly is it for men, or women, to vſurpe out of time, and counterfaite the couers and ornaments of their former defects? And what a ſhame for a man to play the boy, or (which is worſe) the womans part? or that the matrone ſhould be ſuch a turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe to the follies of a litle girle?

               <p>8. Theſe ornamentes, when they be not out of their ſeaſon, they are in ſeaſon, when out of meaſure, they are ridiculous: but when they be falſe and<note place="margin">Clem.

But if they be not faire by benefit of nature; then applying this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit gloze to their faces, they make open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the beholders, that they want beauty.</hi> Is it I pray you, laudable in a woman, or any wayes to be eſteemed, that her face can performe the office of a wall; as fitt, or fitter to receiue al variety of colours, then ſhe? Is this an endowment, for which to be held either in loue, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration with men? Is it any commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to depend on the lye-pott, on the cockle ſhell, for colour of the checks? or vpon the dead ſcull, perhaps of a damned perſon, for counterfait haire? What baſe, vgly, gaſtly, and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble furniture is this, therby to ſet forth either the feature of the face, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the qualities of the mind?</p>
               <p>9. It remayneth then, that the ſcope of coſtly apparell, of ſtarching, of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and falſifying nature, is only and wholy to pleaſe the lookers on: what then? Is all this adoe that fooles be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,

For as the cooke when he perceaueth his meates tainted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth more ſpices on the ſauce; ſo when the conſcience is inwardly guilty of the baſenes and vnworthines of the ſoule: then, forſooth, to diſſemble and couer the inward imperfections, the earthen veſſel of the body without muſt be adorned; the rotten wood muſt be guilded; the drowſie Aſſe muſt put on a Lyons skinne; the baſe minded Clowne muſt maske it out in the robes of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.

But rather they were commaunded to teſtifie, by their cloathing, their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to God, &amp; their reſpect to his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:28026:47"/> commaundements, their loyalties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their wiues, and their kind and man-hood towards all. And when their apparell is ſuch an argument of maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they contemne beaſtly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and liue by reaſon and Gods law, not by fancy and ſenſuality: then their wiues loue them, their children reſpect them, their ſeruants and ſubiects obey them, their friends honour them, their enemies dread them, yea the very Diuels themſelues, that ſet enemies a worke, are afraid of a modeſt man that feareth God; who (as they know) protecteth him, and honoureth him, becauſe he knoweth himſelfe, and acknowledgeth his duety, and loueth Chriſtianity, and according to his degree keepeth himſelf within his bounds.</p>
               <p>19. Women likewiſe, who ſtand in need of comfort, and help from God &amp; man, appeare amiable to both, when their attire, and all their deportmentes beare witnes of their modeſty, &amp; chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which vertues are not ſolitary nor alone where they reſide; as the contrary want not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of other vices.

Owe we ſo much to the dole of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, or to the gaſtly ſpectacle of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened earth; as to honour our fall by the one, &amp; our corruption by the other with a coſtly maske of curioſity prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? I haue heard of diuers fortunate ſea-faring men, who returning home with a rich booty, haue entred the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in triumph and brauery, their ſailes and topſailes of ſilke, diſplayed with oftentation. But I neuer heard of of any that ſolemnized his ſhipwrack in ſuch a faſhion, if he were not mad; &amp; much leſſe did it on purpoſe to runne vpon the rockes. In like ſort, it may ſeeme a prepoſterous errour to attire ſuperfluouſly theſe bodys of ours which haue already receaued an irreuocable ſentence of death, and runne on by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures motion, directly (as to ſhipwrack) to our death-bed, and to the loathſome

               <p>17. When the Spider out of her owne bowels hath ſpunne her curious habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the webbe; then commeth the ſweeper with his broome, and in a trice defaceth all ſhe hath done. And when the beſt part of our life, of our time, of our money, and of our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtudy, haue beene ſpent in cloathing our body &amp; trimming it vp, a little after entreth death, called by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name, <hi>Stoupe gallant</hi> and with one daſh caſteth all into duſt: Your richeſſe (ſaith S. <hi>Iames</hi>) are putrified, and your<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> garments eaten vp by the mothes. But aboue all, the acknowledgement of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Gods finall iudgment, ſhould worke in vs reſtraint of this vanity. And though ſuperfluity and curioſity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell were not otherwiſe offenſiue to his diuine maieſty or hurtfull to vs, then only in reſpect that it waſteth our time, &amp; withdraweth our cogitations from our laſt account, and the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our hartes, from the memory, loue, and reuerence of God: yet it is to be eſtemed as very hurtful, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:28026:57"/> 18. Man was created to the likeneſſe of almighty God, that his principall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation ſhould be to thinke vpon his Creator, to loue him, to ſerue him, to conuerſe with him, and to liue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his preſence. Wherfore he muſt withdraw himſelfe from all impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or contrary diſtractions, which turne his eye another way, diminiſh, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or extinguiſh his care &amp; affection towardes his maiſter, &amp; maker, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his endeauours, or the execution of what he is to do, if he will not be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and puniſhed as a careleſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruant. For what Maiſter would keep a lubber in his houſe which ſhould ſpend all the day in putting on his cloathes? Heereupon is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of our Sauiour: <hi>Be not ſolicitous of your body what to weare:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> not much time nor care of apparel: but be content with that which is eaſy &amp; ready to be had in this kind, through my prouidence. The cauſe of which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is for that a Chriſtian which hopeth to get to heauen, ought ſo to be wholy and perpetually in the memory and contemplation of heauenly thinges,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:28026:57"/> and in the execution of his neceſſary or charitable employmentes, &amp; ſo entierly occupied with them, that he ſhould haue no leaſure to thinke of trifles; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which is the care &amp; curioſity of ſuperfluous apparell, when it had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad intention nor effect, but only loſſe of time: chooſing rather to be a Lilly of the field; then a Puppet of the Taylors ſhop.</p>
               <p>19. But when it ſhalbe proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs in the laſt iudgement, that we haue in this life beene more carefull to beautifie the body, then the ſoule; leſſe carefull and circumſpect to pleaſe the eyes of God, then to preſent to the world a falſe couer to a filthy carcaſſe; that where Almighty God ſhould be the chiefeſt end and period of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, we haue allotted the beſt part of them and the flower of our yeares, to the ſeruice and idolatry of our bodyes: what a dreadfull and horrible caſe will this then appeare, though there were no other ſinnes in conſequence therof, the Iudge being iuſtly offended, and his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence not appealable? It is therfore no leſſe wiſe then Chriſtian reſolution of

               </p>
               <p>20. But alas, the curioſity of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is not only in it ſelfe euill, nor to the party alone that vſeth it; but for the moſt part to others alſo, in conſequence, as hath beene ſaid. Wherefore when they ſhall ſee, that by their folly they haue not only brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to hel, but alſo many more created to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Almighty God, and bathed in the precious bloud of Chriſt; what a confuſion will it be to them, and what horrour, to haue ſuch a ſpectacle, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, before their eyes?</p>
               <p>21. In ſome ſort excuſable is that treſpaſſe which occaſioned by folly and frailty, cauſeth only the offendants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall hurt: but exceſſiue, odious, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, &amp; moſt puniſhable is that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, with which the delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others alſo to damnation. As if men and women in this life were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes in the diuells harueſt, by their wanton apparell, their painting, their trimming, their foule ſhamefull naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſet out themſelues to ſale, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure

               <p>22. The Diuell knoweth, that man is a noble creature, and by inſtinct of his iudgement and naturall reaſon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth ſenſuall pleaſure, as a thing common to brute beaſtes: And therfore to garniſh and grace it for ſeduction, he vſeth, as an inſtrument of deceit the laſciuious attire wherin the light wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is clad, as a ſerpent to kill her ſight. No Baſiliske is more dangerous, no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime ſo hurtfull, no influence ſo infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no contagion ſo mortall, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt mind vnder the attire of a Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane. O vnworthy employment of a Chriſtian woman, to make her ſelfe a guilded goblet to entertaine deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, powred in by Sathan, for bane of the world; to adorne and beautifie with art his filthy baites of concupiſcence; to betray man to hell, whoſe help and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

O wreched woman, if thou haſt no care of thine owne ſoule, giuen ouer to ſenſuality, and willingly liuing, or rather feſtering and dying in ſlauery and corruption: yet beare reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to man, who neuer gaue thee iuſt cauſe to hate him; &amp; much leſſe to hurt him willingly, and deſtroy him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the dignity of his eſtate, as Lord and Soueraigne ouer all earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: value the worth of his body and ſoule, redeemed from thy firſt folly, and his fragility, by the precious death of Chriſt Ieſus: behold the height of his calling, to be cittizen of heauen, and a partaker of the eternal ioyes of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place: looke below, and view that opened hideous infernall gulfe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto thou wouldeſt bring him: contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with attention and leaſure, thoſe horrible endleſſe tormentes, into which thou wouldeſt plunge him &amp; thy ſelfe: and then doubtleſſe (if thy hart be not

Wherin if thou be careleſſe and cruell: know, that Almighty God will take the matter into his owne hand, as moſt commonly he doth; and euen in this life, by diſgrace, penury, want, ſickneſſe, or otherwiſe, will chaſtice thine offence.

               <p>24. If once he diſdayned to looke vpon <hi>Luciſer</hi> and his companions, who, forgetting from whence they had the perfections of nature and grace that ſhined in them, fell in loue with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and became obiectes of fooliſh

               <p>25. If the ſtarres in the firmament did not dutifully ſet forth God his honour &amp; renowne, but rather ſought by pride to magnify themſelues, they

               <p>4. The appetite then of drinke, is occaſioned through temper of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hoate, and dry, either naturall vpon good diſgeſtion, or vicious proceeding from corruption of ſurfer, heat of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, labour, abundance of choler, euill cuſtome of much drinking, (as <hi>Plinie</hi>

               <p>5. Now then, it followeth to declare the effects of beare, wine, or any other drinke, that is receaued into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make: the knowledge wherof impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth greatly to make vs temperate, and vtter enemies of all exceſſe in this kind. Firſt there is a generall cauſe, for which a reaſonable man ought to vſe great moderation in his nouriſhment, either of meat, or drinke. For, as drinke in particular conueyeth the meate downe to the ſtomake, and bringeth it to a good proportion and temper of diſgeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo is it alſo nouriſhment of it ſelfe, to be diſgeſted, or elſe if it haue no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, to be euacuated. And in this, the nutritiue faculty is diſtinguiſhed in operation, and differeth from the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue: that the nouriſhing faculty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ouercome the qualities of the meate and drinke, as doth alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue; yet notwithſtanding, the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſo ouercometh, as it entertayneth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:28026:66"/> the prey it hath gotten, and conuerteth it ſubſtantially into the precedent parts of the body to be nouriſhed: wheras the expulſiue faculty, when it hath power, caſteth out by excrement all ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as is not conuenient for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And though the ſtomacke, through naturall heat gaine the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority ouer drinke, and ſo make it fit for nouriſhment and humectation of the whole: yet the ſame ſtomake and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat ſuffereth a repaſſion in the diſgeſtiue facultie, from drinke; by which it is continually weakened, and made leſſe and leſſe able to diſgeſt, and to make both the drinke &amp; meate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>6. In this manner, we ſee that a ſtrong VVraſtler, whileſt he caſteth downe his weaker aduerſary, is yet therby rebated in his ſtrength; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, would looſe it all, by a great number of ſuch victories: ſo although the naturall heat of the ſtomake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the aduerſe qualities of drinke, yet is it debilitated, extenuated, and made of leſſe force by the battayle: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this repaſſion in the daily victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:28026:66"/> of the ſtomake ouer drinke (though all other cauſes were remoued) it alone would finally procure old age, death, and deſtruction, later or ſooner, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuely as the drinke taken in, is more or leſſe, of this or that quality, and the complexion of the drinker ſtronger, or weaker.</p>
               <p>7. Moreouer, we are to diſtinguiſh (with <hi>Galen</hi>) in all the partes of mans<note place="margin">Galen l. 4. de vſu part. c. 13.</note> body, three ſortes of faculties that ſerue to diſgeſtion: one is the faculty <hi>Attractiue,</hi> the other <hi>Retentiue,</hi> the third <hi>Expulſiue.</hi> The power <hi>Attractiue</hi> is inſtituted by nature, that euery part of mans body may drawe vnto it ſelfe, as it were from the common ſtore houſe, what by ſimilitude of nature is fitteſt and moſt proper for nouriſhment: being firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and diſpoſed by the heat of the ſtomake, according to neceſſity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery part. Then for that the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritiue faculty cannot performe dew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration about the food attracted, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be applyed, and as it were held faſt by handes, to the organ, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nutrition: nature retayneth ſtrongly what before ſhe had drawne to

Wherfore,

For if wine and beere haue force to worke this effect in the wood of the barrell, much more when they lye long in the ſtomake, through the exceſſe of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall drinking, they procure this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſiue and crabbiſh diſpoſition in the tender bulke of the ſame. And no doubt but this biting gall, as it hindereth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and is painefull to the drinkers making them irckſome to themſelues: ſo alſo they become harſh in conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and troubleſome to others.</p>
               <p>14. To this bad conſtitution of the ſtomake by abundance of drinke, may be added in conſideration the dregges of putrifaction and choler, which Wine, Ale, or Beere drunke out of meaſure, leaue behinde them; which from the ſtomake flow and are diſperſed through all the partes of the body. And hence it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:28026:71"/> proceedeth, according to obſeruation, that Northren nations abound comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more with this kind of choler bred of indiſgeſtion, then others: for that nature hauing prouidently giuen them hoater liuers to reſiſt the cold of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which with the ſame alſo is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> and repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) they drinke more then others, and are more ſubiect to exceſſe, if with reaſon and temperance it be not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. But for better vnderſtanding of this matter it is to be knowne that there be two kindes of choller, the one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall which cauſeth animoſity &amp; fearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, riſing from the hoate, agile, and quick ſpirits which one hath by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of nature, and may be increaſed by fumes of drinke that heat the braine; in which ſenſe <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that wine cauſeth men to be headlong in wrath. But there is another choler accidentall ingendred in the ſtomake by indiſgeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and putrifaction of ſuperfluous meat and drinke, which being continued by ſurfets, breedeth a permanent quality of the ſame nature in the ſtomake, and conſequently a like habitual diſpoſition

And in this ſenſe we take cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in this place, ſpeaking of accidentall and vnnaturall choler, that proceedeth from putrifaction in the ſtomake, and immoderate drinke. And according to this ſober reckoning, the vice is ſeene to be deteſtable: for this diſtemperance of the ſtomake, and conſequently in the bloud &amp; ſpirites cauſeth bitterneſſe and teaſtineſſe in the very operation of the ſoule, and baniſheth that ſweetneſſe of life, which nature hath otherwiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, as a reward of temperance in ſuch as be maiſters of themſelues.</p>
               <p>15. Beſides, this accidentall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural choler is an oppoſite diſpoſition to all good abearance towardes ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, equals, and inferiours. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be accounted an harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition, when a man cannot liue with his wife, his children, nor with his familie or friendes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall brauling, and breach of a mitie:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:28026:72"/> wherby not only he looſeth that delight which he might enioy by quiet and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable conuerſation, and tormenteth himſelfe inwardly by euery occaſion with bitterneſſe of wrath and diſlike: but moreouer he purchaſeth at a very deere rate, and without any profit, the disfauour and hatred of others, as many as muſt liue in his company, or haue any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>16. Neither is this choler, of which we ſpeake, that which ſerueth as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to valour and fortitude, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other beaſtly humour that makes a man brutiſh and good for nothing. For (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) where it aboundeth there are not to be found thoſe ardent &amp; gallant ſpirites, which other people in hoater climates, or in the ſame, that be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their drinke haue by nature and good complexion, their bodyes being more dry, their bloud more pure, and their ſpirits more Etheriall; whoſe choler is temperate, but conſtant, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: and therfore as it is not moued but by reaſon, ſo is it reaſonable, and laſteth as long as by reaſon it ſhould: where the other brutiſh perturbation,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:28026:73"/> as it is eaſily vp, to contradict, braule, &amp; reuile, ſo is it done with the drinke, or at leaſt when the fumes are diſgeſted and fitter for the tauerne then for the field. For great drinkers, though they abound with accidentall choler, and are tall fellowes when they are armed with drinke, yet their bodys are full of moyſt and cold humors, which make them heauy and cowardly, eſpecially if any danger be preſented vpon cold bloud.</p>
               <p>17. Beſides, who is cholerike in this manner cannot poſſibly be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in contemplation, or prudent in practiſe; for that reaſon and iudgement is either wholly oppreſſed in him, or very much hindered by his turbulent beaſtly choler: yea it ſuffereth not the tongue to deliuer, the month to vtter, nor the hand to execute orderly, what the minde hath conceaned, but with fury and confuſion ordinarily breaketh out into diſhonourable and reprochfull, yea ſometime into ſacrilegious &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous wordes: and cauſeth a man to do with precipitation and haſt, that which afterwardes he is to bewayle by leaſure. And this humour abounding,

Now, when their common knot and roote, the Braine, is ill affected and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered by the vampe and vapour of ſuperfluous drinke; conſequently the ſenſe of feeling is euery where hindred: and taſting alſo (which according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is a kind of feeling) is likewiſe benummed; and ſo, firſt the pleaſure which nature affoardeth to eating and drinking is diminiſhed and decayeth: And next, from thoſe vapours of drinke engroſſed aboue in the head, ſtreameth downe into euery part of the body an infinite number of diſeaſes, as Catarrs, Aches, Palſies, the falling ſickneſſe, and the like: and among the reſt, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make receaueth back againe with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and hurt, that which firſt it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned with exceſſe. <hi>Much drinke</hi> (ſaith Galen) <hi>hurteth the ſinewes, and their organ</hi>

               <p>24. This defluxion from the head to the ſtomake and other partes, is not like to that, which firſt drawne from the earth in vapours, deſcendeth after from thence againe in dew and rayne to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilize the ground, nature repaying with gaine what erſt ſhe borrowed of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie: but contrariwyſe, the indiſgeſted vampe of ſuperfluous drinke mounting from the ſtomake to the head, and there engroſſed by the cold quality of the braine, falleth down after vpon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make as poyſon and putrifaction, to it, and to all the reſt of the body; not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſinne repaying with penalty that which a litle before not nature, but ſinne exacted with inordinate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſenſuality. Surely it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme folly and madnes, for a man, by the ſpoute of his throat, to annoy thus his health: to ouerflow himſelfe with a flood of wateriſh humours: to make paſſage for an vnnaturall corrupt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               <p>26. And the like effect may be ſeene in a veſſell of water vpon the fier, where the greater heate cauſeth alwayes more vapour and ſmoake, then if the fire be leſſe. In fine, thoſe drinkers which haue the moyſteſt and coldeſt braynes with equal ſtomaks, beare moſt drinke, which

Reaſon is allured to taſt, by vertue: and Senſe prouoked to the ſame, by pleaſure. And ſo, the organ of taſt (a parcell of the body) is as it were bayted with the contentment which it receaueth in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and therby is increaſed the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to eat and drinke. Reaſon alſo, knowing that the charge and cuſtodie of the body is committed to the ſoule, and that by due vſe of food and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated yet this office is to be performed, accordingly, in reſpect of this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; for the ſeruice of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth (of which euery one ſhould be a profitable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber according to his degree) ſeeketh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly and wholſomly to feed it.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:28026:82"/> of nature and vertue. But when Senſe precedeth and commandeth, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon followeth; not only the ſoule, in this paſſage contrary to all bound and terme of Iuſtice and duety, is debaſed and held in vile ſlauery by the ſenſuall appetite: but the very body is iniured by this prepoſterous diſorder, whileſt meat and drinke, which are appointed as naturall meanes for the maintenance of health and ſtrength, giuen ouer to the empire and obedience of ſenſuality, become poyſon and deſtruction of ſenſe it ſelfe; as happeneth to the old Ape, who pampering and embracing her yong ones with too much force of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſtrangleth and killeth them ere ſhe be a ware.</p>
               <p>3. When therefore the vſe of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is with exceſſe, there follow of neceſſity to the drinker two very bad effects: the one, an opinion and note of baſeneſſe, the other a double penalty in the body, and in the ſoule. It is therfore a wonder to conſider, how this fooliſh ſenſuall delight could preuaile ſo much in the world, and enlarge it ſelfe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ages, from one nation to another:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:28026:83"/> But that the iuſt iudgement of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth one vice to ſucced for ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and puniſhment of another: and that Nations &amp; contries degenerating from vertue by degrees, Sinne it ſelfe depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the people to beaſtly exceſſes, the meſſengers and to retellers of their fall at hand.

               <p>4. But to make the errour more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt with an example: let vs ſuppoſe, there were a noble yong Gentleman, Lord of a goodly manour &amp; faire eſtate of land? lying vpon the ſea ſide; who
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:28026:83"/> by negligence, or vpon his pleaſure to go ſometimes a fiſhing neere his houſe, would wantonly affoard the ſea an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to ouerflow his whole ground, and therby be forced (himſelfe and his family) to liue ſome houres euery day in a cock-boat, toſſed vp and downe with the waues during the tide. Such an one (I ſay) looking about him whileſt the ſea were in, when he ſhould behold his lordſhip and land, no land at all but water; and after, when the ſea were our, himſelfe in the middeſt of a mariſh of dirt and mire; what would he ſay and thinke of his owne madneſſe, if he were not worſe then madde? No doubt, the condition of this yong Gallant would be ſoone changed from greatneſſe to baſeneſſe; his meanes from abondance to penury; his eſtate from nobility to beggary.

               <p>5. Why then is drinke permitted to raigne? becauſe it is pleaſant to the taſt. And why doth the taſt obey? for that loue of delight giueth a law. Why doth the ſoule yield to ſo ignominious a law, and ſubiect it ſelfe to the ſcepter of taſt? This hath no other reaſon, but the freedome of mans will, that giueth way to the commandry of ſenſuality ouer reaſon, againſt reaſon: where if the matter which getteth ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this caſe were in any meaſure of nature comparable to the dignity of the ſoule, the diſparagement of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe might ſeeme more tollerable.

               <p>6. And if this Tyranny ſurpriſed the ſoule vpon a ſodain, or gayned vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer it at vnawares; the fault were more pardonable, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He told me, that when he was young and liued in the Court, and in <hi>London;</hi> if by chaunce any baſe companion, as a water man, or the like ſhould be ſeene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with drinke, the Prentices would come out of their ſhops as to a wonder, &amp; cry after him, <hi>a Dutchman, a Dutchman.</hi> Where now (alas) the wondring hath ceaſed, with opinion, that only <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> are drunke: for they meet often not only <hi>English-men,</hi> but (as he ſaid) <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women</hi> alſo, well tipled in Tauernes; which commonly is not ſeene amongſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi> For though the husbands be vnthrifts, and drinke their wits ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

If it be now otherwiſe in England, it is the more ſhame, and the more to be pittyed: though there be no wind ſo bad, that bloweth not profit to ſome body. For the ſame perſon told me, that where in <hi>London</hi> there was wont to be but one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling houſe or tauerne; now, there be 20. and the like may be deemed in other citties and townes.

Seeing therfore that a Chriſtian knoweth, how, through originall ſinne, his body is diſtempered and diſpoſed of it ſelfe to vnquiet the mind, and incline reaſon to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of brutiſh appetite: his office is, and his care ſhould be, rather to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the force of this poyſon, to quench the heat of this fire, and rid himſelfe from the importunity and trouble of ſo baſe and contemptible a commaunder; keeping his body in a temperate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with moderation of diet, yea and with abſtinence from meat and drinke ſometimes (as there is need, and as Chriſtian people vſe, and haue vſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:28026:93"/> to do in all times and places, when and where God is, or hath byn duely ſerued) and by this temperance to defend the ſoule, and keep it pure and free, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the combuſtion of this infernal fier, but from the ſoote, and ſhame of the ſmoke: rather, then to ſeeke fewell to caſt into the fornace, and increaſe the deflagration of this miſerable <hi>Troy.</hi> To what purpoſe muſt youthfull bloud boyling of it ſelfe, be enflamed by the hoat ſpirits of wine, which not only conſume the naturall vigour of the bloud it ſelfe, drying it vp and making it vnfit for generation, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; but alſo, blaſt all the vertues, which as greene plantes flouriſh in the ſoule; and disfigure the ſoule it ſelfe? What brute beaſt is ſo beaſtly, as to adde fier to fier for increaſe of his luſt?</p>
               <p>25. Therfore, when a Chriſtian putteth in practiſe by drinke, that which a beaſt abhorreth by nature; in what degree of abaſement ſhould we hold him?

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:28026:93"/> of his name and perſon, then this perturbation: for where it is not bridled by temperance, and ſubdued with the grace of God, it carryeth away mens actions to the vileſt and baſeſt obiectes, againſt both reaſon and faith; tying them both to the ſtake with an iron chaine of ſlauery; and by litle and litle conſuming into aſhes of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, all which either grace or nature had giuen for ornament; ſo as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth no more of Chriſtianity, but the bare name, nor of man-hood, but the ſhape.</p>
               <p>26. The truth of this miſerable chaunge may be ſeene in a notorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of one, that liued not long agoe famous for the miſchiefe and publike ſcandall that hath followed in theſe parts of the world by his fal into ſinne,<note place="margin">Martin Luther.</note> who, had not only vowed Religion and chaſtity, but liued many yeares chaſt in Angellical profeſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and yet in his declining yeares, by intemperance of gluttony and drunke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, degenerated ſo far from himſelfe, as (meaſuring all by his owne miſery after his fall from Gods grace) amongſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:28026:94"/> other pernicious errours, he taught with ſhame inough, that man could not liue chaſt. Though his meaning was, to couer his incontinent life with an excuſe of impoſſibility; the deceit ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuppoſition of the like intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; that a man giuen ouer to riot and drunkeneſſe, can hardly liue chaſt, which, without preiudice to chaſtity, may be graunted to the Doctors weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that taught this learning; and to the experience of his chiefeſt diſciples, which haue followed his doctrine and life. And yet, for all this, the contrary is moſt certaine, for if Chaſtity could not be kept, Chriſt our Sauiour would neuer haue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailed it to his followers: nor the Apoſtles commended ſo highly this kind of life.</p>
               <p>27. The difference is, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt (which by continuall temperance keep the body ſubiect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the ſoule, and all the ſenſes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in exerciſe of Chriſtian life within the compaſſe of reaſon &amp; faith) as in the reſt of their actions, dedicated wholy to the honour and ſeruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, they imitate the Angels
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:28026:94"/> that ſerue him in heauen: ſo they receaue from him, as a neceſſary ornament of their eſtate (&amp; as a Gods penny of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reward) the precious iewell of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Chaſtity; which in ſome degree aduanceth them aboue the dignity of Angels: Whileſt they conſerue Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call purity in corruptible bodyes of fleſh and bloud, as we ſee performed by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable perſons of both ſexes, holpen (as I ſay) by the grace and aſſiſtance of him that gaue this counſaile &amp; example; helping themſelues alſo, as they ſhould, by auoyding occaſions of temptation, not to giue aduantage to the Diuell, and by the ordinary meanes of temperate diet and abſtinence, yea and of rigorous faſting alſo, and other exerciſes of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance when there is need: which reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the old Heathens could tell were helpes to Chaſtity; and ſo they taught, that <hi>ſine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus.</hi> But theſe new Doctors, becauſe they deſire not to liue chaſt, will not make vſe of this doctrine. Thus we ſee that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and followers of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour by temperance and Chaſtity, are exalted aboue their owne nature, to be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:28026:95"/> like Angels in life; as the others giuing themſelues ouer to gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, become worſe then beaſtes. And ſo no meruaile, if their maiſter and Foreleader taught ſo filthy and beaſtly doctrine, taking the meaſure of mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibility, by himſelfe, and his owne weakneſſe, after he had degenerated to the habit and cuſtome of a beaſtly life.</p>
               <p>28.

And if no countrey clowne be ſo rude and vnmannerly, as to touch the robes of a Prince, without reuerence; or to enter into his priuy-chamber vncalled: what an vnworthy preſumption is it, for the ignominious breath of vndiſgeſted drinke, not only to touch the light of the ſoule, but ouerpreſſe it in captiuity and darkneſſe; yea to ſtrike it dead, till the force of nature holpen by ſleep reuiue it, and reſtore it to liberty.</p>
               <p>31. How, thinke you, will God Almighty, beholding our drunkard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued both of reaſon and ſenſe, and all reſemblance of a man, take this villany co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt the ſoueraignty of his Royall armes, and image in his broad

The Angels alſo, looking vpon the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of a reaſonable ſoule thus annoyed by drinke will hold themſelues highly preiudiced: for that the ſame image &amp; ſimilitude, which they ſee defaced in man, is their principall flower, and the diademe of their Nature and Being. Wherfore, if that force which ſhould turne a mighty Prince out of his robes and eſtate, into the habit and quality of a Peſant, be holden for malignant: how ſtrang and malicious is the fume of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate drinke, which ouermaſtering reaſon, caſteth downe mans high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the baſeſt condition, lower then of the filthieſt beaſt.</p>

We loue our eyes (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) and carefully defend them, becauſe we<note place="margin">Ariſt l. metaph. c. 1.</note> loue knowledge, to which our eye-ſight auaileth much. How much more then, are we to affect and preſerue the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſelfe, by which properly and immediatly we know; and not permit it to be ſtroken with blindneſſe, only to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:28026:97"/> enioy the pleaſure of a litle more drinke then nature doth deſire. Wherfore, if all kind of vice in generall be odious in quality, for as much as it is repugnant and iniurious to nature; and ſo much the worſe, by how much it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: ſeeing then that other ſinnes do only neglect, and as it were contemne reaſon, paſſing by it with diſgrace; this offence of drunkeneſſe which rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth directly againſt it, ſeaſeth vpon it with violence, and killeth it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtarke dead, muſt needs be holden in a moſt ſuperlatiue degree of hatefull deformity and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>33. Which ſuppoſed, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and quality of the obiect, the meaſure of malice is to be eſteemed more or leſſe in any act of mans will: &amp; that a man loſing the vſe of reaſon, is not only depriued of his greateſt good by the intemperance of drinke, but that the ſame loſſe is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily procured by the drunkard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and without any benefit of all to ſoule or body (for what meate or drinke is taken in, more then nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, for ſuſtenance, which is but

               <p>34. If a man ſhould willingly caſt away his money, which ſhould ſerue him for the neceſſary maintenance of himſelfe, his wife, his children, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: no doubt but the folly were very diſpraiſable. Or if by his owne volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary fact he ſhould procure ignominy, and the loſſe of his good name; it would alſo be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned for a fooliſh &amp; vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall iniury. Or if he ſhould willingly and wittingly feed himſelfe with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome and poyſoned food to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his bodies health; would it not be thought he were deſperate and out of his wits? But aboue all the reſt for a man of ſet purpoſe to contriue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his owne ſenſeleſſenes, his owne want of wit and diſcretion, his owne folly, fury, and madnes; is aboue all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon monſtrous and deteſtable. Are there not things now afflictiue &amp; offenſiue to reaſon in this life, as it were
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:28026:98"/> ſo many flying blacke clouds, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe the aire of our element, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the light of our vnderſtanding; but that the wretch with his owne hands muſt raiſe this miſt of darkeneſſe, muſt caſt this ſmoake before his eyes to confound and infatuate himſelfe? And why forſooth? to giue a little paſſing pleaſure to the throate, that dureth no longer but whileſt the liquor is going downe; which beſides the hurt it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the drunkard in his ſoule, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his body alſo to endure long penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty afterwards: a pretty merchandize. Is reaſon and health of no greater a worth then to be caſt a way for ſo ſmall a price? is the drinke taken in of more value, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the health drowned, and the wit vented out? If it be iuſt, that he which hath a ring with a precious ſtone, be carefull to preſerue it from defacing: much more, a man hauing ſo precious a iewell as a reaſonable ſoule in his body, is to keep it carefully from all iniury. But becauſe humane diligence is not alwayes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintaine the ſoule in purity, to keep this shining beame of reaſon vnclowded, and vndazeled this eye of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:28026:99"/> the ſoule; we muſt make recourſe to Almighty God, that he by his eſpeciall grace will preſerue this eye, and fortify it with internall light againſt externall darkeneſſe.</p>

For then ruſh out of the imagination (as it were) ſo many furies of hell, the horrible and gaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of foule fiends, to fright a troubled and tormented ſoule; putting the poore wretch in plight, as if now he were in the paines of hell.

According to this, what help can any ciuill community receaue, or expect from drunkards, that are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall in all matters of importance, and ſo lauiſh and vnbridled in the reſtraint of all corrupt qualities and affections; and prone to put in execution, in all times, places, and occaſions, without controlement, whatſoeuer folly and frenzy may ſuggeſt? But in particuler, choler &amp; cruelty, which attend alwayes on drunkenneſſe, make it barbarous &amp; vnſupportable in any commonwealth.

               <p>18. Next to Magiſtrates, the vice of drunkenneſſe (though foule in all) is moſt deteſtable &amp; pernicious in women in reſpect of their progeny; for from intemperate parents deſcend naturally vicious and diſorderly children. And perhaps from this proceeded the ruine of great Monarchies (next to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:28026:109"/> of Gods iuſtice) that as they were rayſed by valiant men, begotten and brought vp in temperance: ſo they were loſt by effeminate cowards, bred in riot and exceſſe of meate and drinke. <hi>Plato</hi> in his common wealth forbiddeth wine to women with child; And the <hi>Romans</hi> enacted many ſeuere lawes to debarre women from wine: and the vſe therof was infamous amongſt them. And the cuſtome for kinsfolkes to ſalute their kinſwomen, is ſayd to haue beene intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for a tryall, to find if they ſmelled of wine. And at this day the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> want not their neceſſary prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this caſe, to keep their women temperate and chaſte. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not only the ſeruice but the ſecurity of the common wealth: ſeeing that drunkenneſſe depriueth men both of iudgement and true fortitude, which are the keyes, and ſupporters of a ciuill eſtate; whatſoeuer externall Enemy ſhall endeauour to make a prey of a people where it raigneth, may be greatly aduantaged by this vice.</p>
               <p>19. But heere one may aske me, what remedy for thirſt: if drink be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:28026:110"/> I anſwere, that drinke is not forbidden nor diſſwaded, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and immoderate vſe of drinke: nor thirſt is alwayes to be remedied with drinke: as we ſee in a dropſie, which cauſeth vehement and continuall thirſt, and yet is ſo farre off to be quenched, or the diſeaſe to be cured by drinking, as the only way to be rid of both the cauſe &amp; the effect, is to abſtaine from drinke. In like manner, he that was drunke ouernight, is commonly thirſty in the morning, as aboue hath byn ſaid. And if he will quench this thirſt proceeding from ſurfet, by powring drinke vpon drinke, he ſhal be thirſty all his life. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thirſt cauſed by the operation of naturall heat, that dryeth vp naturall moyſture, is to be refreſhed by drinke. But accidentall thirſt, that proceedeth from the corruption of meate or drinke in the ſtomack, is by abſtinence to be remoued; and by little and little will diminiſh of it ſelfe, if you giue nature leaue &amp; time to diſgeſt the excrements, which like a dunghill breath out thoſe hoate putrified vapours, that infect the throat, and the mouth.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:28026:110"/>
               <p>20. And amongſt many other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of drunkards, it is no ſmall one to be continnally tormented with thirſt: as the contrary, to be rid of this miſery, as temperate men be, me thinks ſhould be ſufficient to perſuade any man to be temperate; though there were no other reward for vertue, nor puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vice, but in this life.

Thom. 2. 2. q. 89. art. 1.</note> the inuocation &amp; atteſtation of diuine authority maketh the thing, for which it is brought, iuſtly credible, and to be belieued.</p>
               <p>2. Thus hauing deſcribed an oath by all the partes and cauſes therof; we are to know, that there be two kinds of oaths: one is called <hi>aſſertiue,</hi> to wit, an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:28026:113"/> oath which affirmeth the verity of thinges either paſt, or now preſent in action, or to come; as if one ſhould ſweare, that he himſelfe, or another, was in ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, and vttered theſe or theſe words; or that he is not culpable of any crime: or that there is no harme to follow, which may be feared without cauſe; and the like. The other is called <hi>promiſſiue,</hi> when a man bringeth the authority of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as a witneſſe and ſurety, that he will performe ſuch a matter as he promiſeth: which manner of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring implyeth, in ſome part, an oath <hi>aſſertiue;</hi> which is, that now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he hath an actuall purpoſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what is by him promiſed; as the <hi>aſſertiue</hi> oath aforeſaid of things to come, inuolueth a promiſe. And in both kinds is found one, and the ſame diuine authority; by which, proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, to the end that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the verity of things ſworne either by way of aſſertion, or of promiſe.</p>
               <p>3. Theſe oaths, that they may be lawfull and honeſtly giuen, or taken, require three conditions ſpecified in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:28026:114"/> word of God, and included in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of nature. <hi>Thou shalt ſweare</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">Hier. 4.</note> Almighty God) <hi>Our Lord liueth, in truth, and in iudgement, and iniuſtice:</hi> ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we affirme, or promiſe any thing vpon an oathe, the matter ſworne ought to be accompanied with theſe three qualities, that is, with <hi>truth, iudgment,</hi> and <hi>iuſtice.</hi> As concerning the firſt, the matter is euident; for it muſt needs be a ſacrilegious offence, miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gods diuinity to bring it to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe falſehood: for, as Almighty God is in himſelfe an infallible Truth, and prime author therof; ſo alſo is he infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in reuealing and witneſſing; and it is impoſſible that he either can be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or deceaue. Wherupon, to induce him, as a witneſſe of an vntruth, is a maine treſpaſſe, and abuſe againſt his eternall Verity. Wherfore, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is euidently neceſſary, not only in an oath of aſſertion, but of promiſe alſo. So that if one vpon his oath ſhould promiſe the performance of a thing, and ſo promiſing not retayne inwardly a purpoſe, or thinke himſelfe vnable, to accompliſh his promiſe; he ſhould be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:28026:114"/> periured, &amp; offend immediatly againſt the high and ſoueraigne Truth of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
               <p>4. Moreouer, the matter ſworne is to be <hi>iuſt and lawfull,</hi> not repugnant to any vertue, or other requiſite obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as it is a heinous fault againſt diuine Truth to make it a witneſſe of falſity; ſo is it alſo, to auouch it in confirmation of wickedneſſe, whether it be aſſertion or promiſe. And indeed, whatſoeuer wicked obiect is alſo practically &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally falſe; that is not to be don by man: and therfore diuine authority being brought to affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me, or confirme that which is vnlawful and ought not to be, is iniured and diſgraced: furthermore, it may fall out (namely in an oath of aſſertion) that the matter which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed be true in it ſelfe, and yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to be eſteemed falſe, becauſe it is vnlawfull, as if one vpon his oath ſhould diſcouer a ſecret ſinne of another againſt ciuility, naturall ſecreſie, and charity: ſuch an oath ſhould not include falſhood, oppoſite to any ſpecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arine Truth, yet notwithſtanding it ſhould be ſacrilegious, and an impeachment
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:28026:115"/> of Gods authority, for as much as it is taken againſt iuſtice of charity and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility.</p>
               <p>5. Laſtly, for that the exhibition of an oath is a matter of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it ought to be don with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that is, with prudent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth, and decencie of the thing ſworne, whether in way of aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or promiſe. The neceſſity of which condition is originally deriued from the dignity and authority of Almighty<note place="margin">S. Thom. 2. 2. q. 8. art. 3. ad 3.</note> God, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations of Almighty Gods authority, ſuppoſeth a reuerent faith in him that ſweareth, that it is able to confirme all truth, and to diſcouer and deſtroy all falſity: and therfore, ſwearing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature and right) is vſed, only vpon neceſſity of procuring that, which is good either for the common wealth, or for priuate perſons, when there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth other meanes to diſcouer the truth. And this proteſtation by diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt iſſue from iudgment; as wel about the certaine truth and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the thing ſworne, as alſo about the neceſſity of ſwearing: for to ſweare
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:28026:115"/> for euery ſmall matter, or where there is no vrgent cauſe, is to ſweare in vaine; and therby to miſpriſe the Maieſty of God againſt his commaundement.</p>
               <p>6. Hereby may be vnderſtood, that the taking of an oath rightly, inueſted and accompained with all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is good and lawfull: yea, an act of Religion &amp; ſupreme worſhip towards Almighty God. That it is a laudable act in it ſelfe, will appeare, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it only in reſpect of ciuility or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall piety. For an oath in it ſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth no diſhonour vnto Almighty God, or harme to man, when we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch diuine authority in witneſſe of any thing affirmed, or promiſed: yea rather we honour Almighty God; making him vmpier and chiefe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of all humane affaires; and by his name and authority ending controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; eſtabliſhing humane fidelity in contractes, in ſeruices and good offices betweene man and man; as betweene ſuperiours and inferiours, and equalls among themſelues; which muſt needs be holden a practiſe conformable to reaſon, and conſequently vertuous and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:28026:116"/> iuſtifiable.</p>
               <p>7. In this reſpect, the Roman ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier obliged and ſacred himſelfe to God and his countrey by corporall oath: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the ſame euery yeare vpon the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> Phiſitians alſo (as S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> recordeth) according<note place="margin">Greg.

               <p>8. Now if we regard the diuine law of Almighty God, we ſhall ſee that it approueth an oath duely made, as an act of vertue, and an eſpeciall inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and meanes for the keeping of ciuill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. <hi>Thou shalt feare thy Lord God, and ſerue</hi>

               <p>9. Two arguments which the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes vſe to alleadge, may ſeeme to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people to haue ſome difficulty: and therfore are to be diſcuſſed. Firſt (ſay they) to indeauour to honour Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by calling him to witneſſe when we ſweare, may ſeeme ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſeeing his authority and name is alleadged to no other end then to atteſt and manifeſt a truth; but if he which ſweareth by diuine authority, ſhould conceiue with himſelfe, that the ſame authority will therfore approue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the thing ſworne by him, it were an errour of ſuperſtition: and for this reſpect they ſay, it is not lawfull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch Gods authority in witneſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing proteſted by an oath.</p>
               <p>10. But this oppoſition is not of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:28026:117"/> force againſt that which we haue ſayd: for he that ſweareth, doth not intend princically that Almighty God ſhould miraculouſly reueale the truth; but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the matter entierly to his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make lawfull the inuocation of a teſtimony, from the authority of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that one day (according to the Apoſtle) he will lay open to the<note place="margin">1.

And that which he that ſweareth principally intendeth, is as it were to make an adioynder and connexion of Gods eternall truth vnto his words; by which coniunction, ſuch words may appeare to others true, and worthy to be belieued.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:28026:117"/> thy oathes to thy Lord. But I ſay to you, ſweare not at all. Let your talke be yea, yea, no, no; and that which is ouer and aboue this, is of euill.</hi> Notwithſtanding, theſe words of our Sauiour do not abſolutely forbid ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in neceſſary caſes, as holy Fathers<note place="margin">Bernard. hom. 65. in Cantic. Bed. in cap 5. Iacob.</note> do teach: but only counſaile perfection in this kind, proper to Chriſtians, and ſurpaſſing the quality of the ſynagogue. And the contrary commeth of euill, in as much as it repugneth to Chriſtian perfection, that there ſhould be need of oathes, although they be not abſolutly forbidden, when they are needfull. Therfore by way of Counſaile our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour perſuadeth vs not to ſweare, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon light occaſions, as the Iew did, thinking therby to honour God; but only vpon neceſſary or important cauſes: that is, not to ſweare in vaine, although the matter which is ſworne be true. And by this paſſage and the like we may vnderſtand, how neceſſary it is, that there be ſome certaine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of paſtors and teachers for the certain deliuery of truth in the holy Scripture, to preſerue our priuate interpretations from errour and hereſie.</p>

Now, it remayneth that we declare to what vertue it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. And concerning this point, it is moſt certaine, that a lawfull oath is an act of Religion, which among the morall vertues is of high quality. For although he that ſweareth doth not principally intend to honour God by his proteſtation, but only purpoſeth to approue ſome truth: neuertheleſſe, by ſwearing, he intendeth to proteſt his faith about the infallible truth of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and ſo bringeth it in as a ſacred and potent witneſſe of the truth by him auouched: therfore in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſpecifying the excellencie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in his oath, he honoureth him with an outward ſigne, and that with ſupreme ſubiection and ſeruice of <hi>Latria,</hi> which is a worſhip proper only to Almighty God.</p>

               <p>3.

               <p>10. It were an horrible crime (ſayth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) to auouch that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Auguſt. tract. 1. in 1. c.

               <p>11. Next after the truth of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, entreth into conſideration his ſanctity: which againſt periury hath an eſpeciall oppoſition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and defiance. For the matter and ſubſtance of falſehood, ſuch as it hath,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:28026:138"/> is of that malignant nature, that entier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indiuiſibly it is euill: that is (as the Diuines vſe to ſpeake) intrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vicious, repugnant to reaſon, and naught.

The ſelfe ſame action of ſtealth, which is damnable, committed by a thiefe: may in another perſon, or with other circumſtances, as in caſe of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full warre, or the like, be iuſtifiable: as it is, for one to take away another mannes goods, yea his life alſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of publike lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

               <p>2.

But yet there is an other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of idle and vaine ſwearing, worſe in quality, and more oppoſite to religion then the former: that is, when a man aduiſedly ſweareth by God, or by the humanity of Chriſt our Sauiour, not caring whether the thing be true or falſe, only by chaunce; applying Gods eternall and immutable certaine truth to the vncertaine verity of the thing which he ſweareth: Which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſwearing muſt needs be an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous treſpaſſe. For if we conſider on the one ſide the ſoueraigne dignity of diuine nature, and the ſacred quality of our Sauiours humanity, of his body, his ſoule, his honourable and amiable wounds: and on the other ſide, heare a man hudle them out by oaths, as it were caſting dice to fal at their chaunce, not caring what ſide fall vpward: although the oath light on that ſide which is true, yet notwithſtanding the abuſe &amp; impiety is paſſing great. A man in his witts, according to very manhood,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:28026:146"/> would not ſo hazard his owne credit as to caſt it out without all reſpect, in euery occaſion to teſtifie as well falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as truth: and much leſſe ſhould he vtter out of his mouth theſe ſacred oathes to caſuall auouchment of truth or falſehood.</p>

And this perill, if it be generally probable in all other ſinnes, it is much more certaine, where there is cuſtome to ſweare, without pondering whether the thing ſworne be true or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>12. O monſtruous boldnes, and blindnes of impiety, not only to name this maieſty and ſanctity without due reuerence: but to proteſt it in ordinary talke without premeditation or iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement! If the oath meet with truth, no thankes to the ſwearer: for he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:28026:146"/> ſwore at all aduentures, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the waight of diuine teſtimony to chaunce, as one that cared not with what he met.</p>
               <p>13. Hereupon we may vnderſtand what an euill thing is a cuſtome of ſwearing: by which ſome do aduiſedly ſweare by the Maieſty and Sanctity of God, not being certaine whether there by verity or no, in that which they ſweare: wherein cuſtome is ſo far from leſſening the fault, that it rather much increaſeth it. For how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then to aggrauate ſin, when a man by his cuſtome, as it were by his owne hands, tyeth himſelfe in weighty chaines that incline him mightely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all occaſions to ſweare without iudgement of the truth? For as long as<note place="margin">Suar. lib. 3. de ſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento c. 6.</note> cuſtome doth not take away free and aduiſed conſent to ſinne, it doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh but rather maketh greater the fault, in reſpect of the precedent actes by which that habituall diſpoſition to ſinne was contracted. Wherfore when a ſwearer looketh back vpon himſelfe, beholding the euill cuſtome, by which he is incited to ſweare indifferently,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:28026:147"/> whether the matter be true, or falſe: he is obliged in conſcience to reſtraine himſelfe from ſwearing, therby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh ſuch a cuſtome, and as the meanes to auoyd periuries in the time to come. For the ſame obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which bindeth a man not to ſinne, doth alſo oblige him, in what he may to auoyd and remoue the neereſt cauſes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his ſinne.</p>
               <p>14. Moreouer, there is yet a third degree of irreligious ſwearing, when a man applyeth the name of God, or the ſacred humanity of Chriſt to matter, (although true and ſo eſteemed by the ſwearer) yet in it ſelfe vnlawfull: as for example, if one againſt the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſecreſie, ſhould vpon his oath reueile that which he is bound not to diſcloſe. In which manner of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring although the diuine Maieſty, or the ſacred humanity of Chriſt be not debaſed with atteſtation of vntruth: yet are they iniured with an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teſtimony, and made an inſtrument of ſinne.</p>
               <p>15. If the Princes image (as hath beene ſaid) was forbidden by law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:28026:147"/> paine of death to be carried into any filthy or diſhoneſt place: much more care is to be taken, that the holy name of God, and of our Redeemer Chriſt Ieſus, be not brought, I ſay not, to witneſſe things vncleane or loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to our ſenſes, but ſinfull. For this condition to be contaminated with ſinne, exceedeth all other materiall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude whatſoeuer, as far as heauen is aboue earth, and more; as will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare if we conſider that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this world how baſe or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oule ſoeuer it may ſeeme, is ſo oppoſite as the leaſt ſinne to the ſanctity and purity of God and Chriſt our Sauiour. In ſo much as it cannot be clenſed or taken away by any other meanes, force or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, in heauen or in earth, but only by the participation of their purity and ſanctity. Therfore to make the ſame purity and ſanctity ſolemne witneſſes, or inſtruments of ſinne, vpon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is quite contrary to that religious reuerence and honour which we owe them, &amp; a moſt abhominable treſpaſſe.</p>
               <p>16. And in all manner of oathes it is to be noted, that as well he which

                  </gap>umelious ſuppoſition made againſt him.</p>
               <p>17. But much more he diſhonoreth himſelfe, who freely, and without compulſion vſeth to ſweare vpon euery light occaſion for by this frequent foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſinne, he diſcouereth the baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt he hath of his owne honeſty and credit, fearing not to be truſted vnleſſe he ſweare. And why ſhould his perſon or his credit be valued by others, more
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:28026:149"/> then by himſelfe, which knoweth beſt how much they weigh: yea ſuch an one, the more he ſweareth, the leſſe is he to be beleeued: for ſtill he witneſſeth againſt himſelfe. And I call the cuſtome of ſwearing a fooliſh ſinne, as it is the moſt vnprofitable of all the reſt. For the theefe, when he ſtealeth, bringeth ſomething home: he that killeth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth his enemie, and hath one the fewer to be afraid of: and theſe and the like ſinnes, haue (at leaſt) ſome colour of excuſe, as neceſſity, infirmity of mans nature, or the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath none: he looſeth alwayes, getteth nothing by his oathes, and is without all manner of Iuſtification with God or with man: more then that it proceedeth from leuity, ill nourture, inconſideration, and want of wit.</p>
               <p>18. The laſt degree of abuſe in ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is, when great oaths are made only ſignes of mens indignation; of their purpoſes of reuenge; of their braueries; of their manhood, that they dare do this or that; at leaſt that they dare ſweare: which cuſtome ſome fellowes (where other fooliſh &amp; filthy cuſtomes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:28026:150"/> haue gotten place) would grace, by ſaying, that he ſweares like a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but in other places where men are in their wittes, it is more properly ſayd, that he ſweares like a Carter.</p>
               <p>19. The deformity of this manner of ſwearing will be manifeſt, if we conſider how baſe, ignoble, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentleman-like it is be ouer-ruled with Ire; to be enraged like a mad man; to bragge and boaſt of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters done or vndone. For all this trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery thus bluſtered, is nothing els but an vnbridled vnmanerly paſſion, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out from a weake, impotent, &amp; diſtempered mind: and commonly it is ioyned with lying. For the greateſt briggers and ſwearers, vſe to be the greateſt Daſtardes: as when Ruffians, and ſwaggering Cowardes proteſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon oathes that they will doe this, or that; which either they cannot, or dare not performe, In which caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty which they commit; there is alſo a peculiar irreuerence to Almighty God, ſubiecting his holy name &amp; Maieſty to their fooliſh pride or impatience; procuring, by great
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:28026:150"/> oathes, to make the hearers belieue that they will blow downe all that commeth a neere them. What brutiſh folly is it, thus to make the Maieſty of God Almighty, the bloud, and precious Humanity of our Redeemer, ſignes and inſtruments to increaſe madneſſe? For, as cowardly brutiſh wrath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note place="margin">Chryſo. ho. 15. &amp; 16. ad pop. &amp;. Hom. 12. in Matth.</note> out commonly into oathes: ſo do the oathes increaſe this kind of wrath. And hereupon S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that if men would abandon the cuſtome of ſwearing, their perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſooner be calmed.</p>
               <p>20. What can be imagined ſo mild and moderate as the infinite goodnes, longanimity, and mercy of Almighty God? what more gentle and patient then the Lambe of God, Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, in whome was, and is magnanimity, and manhood in the higheſt degree? And therfore to make them arguments, and inſtruments of our impotent fury, and not ſo much manly, as womanly, or beaſtly rage, voyd of all reaſonable reſpect, is an offence directly oppoſite to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and conditions. Which ſuppoſed,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:28026:151"/> how can we expect that the Maieſty of God Almighty ſhould be ſweet, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and patient with vs; if we be ſo impatient, vnmannerly, iniurious, and violent with him?</p>
               <p>21. And truely, this manner of bragging and ſwearing, is ſo far from arguyng a great or generous mind, fit (as they would make it) for a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that contrariwiſe it manifeſteth a degenerous and baſe diſpoſition. For firſt, as hath byn ſayd of apparell, ſo may it now be auouched of ſwearing: that where true inward and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall manhood, and magnanimity is wanting, there the yong Gallant, to make oſtentation of that which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed is not in him, rappeth out oathes at randon, vpon euery occaſion, and without occaſion; as if all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, magnanimity, and courage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the breath of an vnbridled, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill, and ſauage mouth: where, to ſweare in this manner, and prophane the name of God without time or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is a token of Raskallity, want of diſcretion and iudgement, abiection of mind; and no more honour to be
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:28026:151"/> accounted a ſwearer, then to haue his breath to ſtinke.</p>
               <p>22. Secondly, it is not greatneſſe, but baſeneſſe of mind, to be ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with paſſion of rage, as not to be able to rule, neither braynes, nor ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: a thing fitter, as I haue ſaid, for a woman which hath no other weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then for a man. Aſſuredly, there is no greater Daſtard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the world, then the brawling Swearer: and reaſon doth conuince it to be ſo. For, when he dare not reuenge himſelfe of his aduerſary by ſtrokes, for feare to be ſtroken; he breaketh his anger vpon the patient honour of Almighty God, with oaths. And ſo, vpon my word, where thou meeteſt with an ordinary Swearer; ſingle him out for a coward, &amp; put him into thy Calendar vnder that title.</p>
               <p>23. Laſtly, it is certaine, that there cannot be a great mind but accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GENTLE Reader, by theſe three vices, Exceſſe in fooliſh apparell; Swearing; and Drunkenneſſe; thou may make account of the reſt, which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:28026:156"/> haue growne vp like bad wedes in our Country, ſince the manner of tillage in theſe later yeares, was altered from the ancient cuſtome of good husbandry in that land. All of them haue pernicious effects, as experience teacheth, both to priuate perſons, and to the Common welth. For from one bad conſequence, men fall, for the moſt part, to another worſe: as from prodigall ſpending of their owne goods in riot and apparell, they paſſe to play the Cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny-catchers in Cheape-ſide; or to take purſes vpon <hi>Salisbury</hi> plaine. And when that fayleth them, they become Pirates at ſea; and finally, which is worſt of all, turne Mores, or Turkes, and declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to Ieſus Chriſt: of which kind of people, <hi>Argell, Tunis, Constantinople,</hi> and the <hi>Mediterraneum,</hi> and <hi>Ocean</hi> ſeas are ſayd to be full.</p>
               <p>2. Women, in like manner, that be wantonly brought vp, to fare well, and go gay; theſe will engage at leaſt their honeſty, if they find copeſmen, and play other tricks of legier-de-main that may ſtand with their quality, and come within their reach: for, all that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:28026:156"/> is not puniſhable by externall lawes, or ſubiect to open contumely, and ſhame, holdeth within their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences now a dayes.</p>
               <p>3. But the miſery is, that yonge fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes may be witty, but of themſelues they cannot be wyſe; nor vſe to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till they haue bought wit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience with more errours &amp; inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, then ſometimes their liuinges will beare. And therfore we feele day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more the want of the good bringing vp, accuſtomed in our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dayes: by which yong men and women of all degrees, and ſpecially thoſe that were moſt ſubiect to exceed, were kept in awe of God, and with care of their conſciences, when they had graue and religious cenſors of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creteſt thoughts. For ſo, of good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous children, became honeſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable men and women. Good men make alwayes good ſubiects: and of good ſubiect are eaſely made good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates &amp; rulers: for he that can beſt obey, if he doe it with iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is fitteſt to commaund; &amp; all theſe being good, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:28026:157"/> of them) muſt needs be good alſo and floriſh: and this was <hi>Socrates</hi> his induction.</p>
               <p>4. Whence alſo the contrary follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth euidently, and of neceſſity; that, where good bringing vp wanteth, &amp; liberty groweth with yeares; there muſt needs follow in the end great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and diſorders in euery eſtate and condition, from the higheſt to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; &amp; ſuch confuſion in the Common welth, as vnbrideled liberty, prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vice muſt needs bring forth. And notwithſtanding the fouleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorders may be couered with more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and honeſter names, according to the dignity of the perſons where they are found: (as for example, one ſhalbe holden for a Politike Counſellour or Magiſtrate, for the ſame manner of proceding, for which another of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quality ſhould be called a crafty knaue, and the like in other vices) yet in effect all is one, though in the poore man it be termed, as it is in old playne Engliſh; and in the other by a figuratiue ſpeach. But this hindreth nothing, that the fact, if it be euill, remaine not as
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:28026:157"/> damnable in the one as in the other: and generally is more hurtfull to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth, where it is called by the honeſter name, in reſpect of the perſon, who in higher degree may do greater wronges, &amp; more in number with leſſe impeachement, or feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the dignity of his place.</p>
               <p>5. Now, theſe differences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, many tymes, are not ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, nor ſo clearly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood &amp; fore ſeene as they ſhould be, to be preuented in their cauſes. Yea the moſt men reflect not to the rootes of euills, at leaſt to the originall; but reſt in the immediate cauſes: as contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they that want prouidence looke only forward to the immediate effects, and care for no further. The Yonker that comes new to his Lands, to get ready money, maketh of tentymes large bargaines; or taketh vp at Vſury to ſpend idlely, that which quickly will eat him out of houſe &amp; home: looking only vpon the vrgent contentment to follow his phanſies, and ſerue his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent turne. For his thort eyeſight rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not ſo far to ſee, that <hi>extrema gaudij
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:28026:158"/> luctus occupat;</hi> nor remembreth he the many hungry meales, and reſtleſſe nights it coſt his poore parents, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the goods, or purchaſe the lands, which he layeth at once or twiſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his back, or playeth away in few houres at ſix &amp; ſeauens, or ſpendeth it worſe: which many times is a iuſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment of Almighty God, who puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not only the parents in their owne perſons in Hell, but vpon earth alſo in their children, for example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ſins which they committed by iniuſtice &amp; extorſion, or otherwiſe gathering of their wealth; or at leaſt their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as they ought in vertue, or for both together.</p>
               <p>6. Beaſts, notwithſtanding they do many pretty thinges by their ſeuerall inſtincts of nature, which God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of his prouidence, hath giuen to euery one of them in kind, in which he is wonderfull: yet none of them, hath diſcourſe to inferre one truth vpon another, neyther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor backward; from the cauſes to the effects, nor from the effects of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:28026:158"/> their cauſes: for this is only the worke of reaſon, and diſcourſe of man.</p>
               <p>7. And amongſt men, thoſe that haue moſt wiſdome, foreſee the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt in conſequences, to follow what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer action, or reſolution, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection aſcend higheſt to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſes from one to another, till they come to the very firſt orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, roote and fountaine of all. Which in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike and gouerment is neceſſary: for till the Phiſitian or magiſtrate find the true and firſt cauſe of the malady in the naturall, or ciuill body, vnder his charge, they prooceed in the cure as the blind man caſtes his ſtaff, and hits him commonly that is next vnto him, and killeth many tymes inſteed to cure.</p>
               <p>8. If we conſider the preſent ſtate of our Countrey, as well in the exceſſe of the three vices, mentioned in this Treatiſe, as in almoſt all the reſt, or to ſpeake without limitation of (almoſt) comparing it with the auncient ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, modeſty, ciuility, truth in word, and deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religious Chriſtian loue, and charity amongſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelues, and

Now if we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the cauſes of theſe preſent effects and reflect from the fruites to the branches, and from them to the roote; I ſuppoſe any man of iudgment, and diſcourſe will eaſely finde it.</p>
               <p>9. Our Churches (as I am told) are chaunged, in many places, ſome into barnes and ſtables, &amp; others into play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, deuotion into curioſity, prayer in them to Preachments, where the idle ignorant Miniſter intertayneth the people with a tale of a tubb, <hi>ab hoc,

Neyghbourhood is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to encroachment, friendſhip into coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, patronage into oppreſſion, duty into flattery, Religion into policy of ſtate, Ciuility into the exceſſes of riot, drunkenneſſe, and ſwearing reproued in this Treatiſe: and finally to omit many other tranſmutations which I leaue to the Reader, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in apparell, ſpeach and manners, for the moſt part into apes. And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they go in newfangleneſſe, &amp; licenciouſneſſe, if they be let alone? God only knoweth, who permitteth many times diſorders to bring in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as we may hope of his mercy in this caſe, &amp; that he hath not wholy abandoned our Countrey. Which if it be ſo: the worſe the better for thoſe that are to come, if they which now liue would open their eyes, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to conſider the errors which haue brought the people into theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,

               <p>11. If it would pleaſe them only to confer ages, manners, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, paſt in our old fore-fathers dayes, with theſe of ours; and with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of affection and iudgment, giue to ech one his dew: they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly find, that the old Engliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion in all things was far better then the preſent: and that all theſe new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and diſorders come from one; &amp; I thinke may be concluded with the poore mans anſwere, who being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by one of our married Biſhops, of whom he had asked an almes, if he could ſay the Lords prayer: he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he could? which of the two would his Maiſterſhip haue, the old, or the new? The Biſhop bad him ſay both, as he did: and after asked his opinion which of the two he thought was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? the poore man was afraid to ſpeak his mind till the Biſhop promiſed him that he ſhould not be hurt. Then (quoth he) in good faith maiſter I can
